<h1>kalman filter</h1>
Kalman filtering, also known as linear quadratic estimation (LQE), is an algorithm that uses a series of measurements observed
over time, containing statistical noise and other inaccuracies, and produces estimates of unknown variables that tend to be
more accurate than those based on a single measurement alone, by estimating a joint probability distribution over the variables
for each timeframe.
The filter is named after Rudolf E. Kálmán, one of the primary developers of its theory.
